# ISIC_Challenege_DeepLearning
A Deep Learning model made in Tensorflow using an Anaconda enviornment. The model was made to tackle the ISIC's 2019 challenge of creating a neural network which can distinguish between a skin lesion and a malignant skin cancer. The accuracy is 89%, precision is 78%, recall is 65%, and Area Under Curve is 93% after 5 epochs
